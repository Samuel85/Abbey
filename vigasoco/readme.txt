About:
======

VIGASOCO is a framework designed to understand how classic games worked. Its main purpose
is to be a learning tool of the internal working of classic games. The games that VIGASOCO 
runs are "functionally equivalent" conversions from classic games, reverse engineered from
the original code and converted to C/C++.

As a nice side effect, VIGASOCO source code can be used as starting point to make remakes
of classic games, as a framework to develop your own 2D games, to find cheats in the 
original game, to play converted games, etc.


License and distribution:
=========================

VIGASOCO's intention is not to infringe on any copyright on the original games. No portions
of the original ROM code are included in the executable or the sources. The game logic has
been reverse engineered from scratch to obtain a functionally equivalent conversion in a
high level language.

VIGASOCO is a free project. Source code is publically available. 
You're not allowed to sell VIGASOCO and you can't distribute VIGASOCO with ROM images.
Official VIGASOCO sources and binaries should be distributed only in the original 
archives (you can't add or remove files to the archive).

VIGASOCO's core has been written in C++ and it's platform independent. No portion of the 
source can be used in a commercial product without written authorization of the author.
Use of the source code in noncommercial products is allowed, as long as you credit VIGASOCO
somewhere in the documentation of your project. Any derivate work based on a game driver
has to credit the driver author and VIGASOCO.
